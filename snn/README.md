# SNN Framework
@TODO:
- Refactor neuron classes (one prototype with free parameters for subs and named handles of parameters)
- Allow multiple neuron types within network
- Import neuron types from Allen Institute specimen database
- Investigate BCM plasticity in current implementation
- Investigate Oja plasticity in current implementation
- Write gate templates for XOR, OR, AND, NAND, MUX
- Write unit tests
- Implement neural coding templates for inputs as per Guo et al. (2021) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.638474)
